# Breakout!!!
# Breakout is a classic arcade game developed by Atari in 1976
# It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell, Steve Bristow, and Steve Wozniak
# Steve Jobs obvi got his hand in this pot too...
# Breakout is arguably one of the most influential games in the history of computing
# And now, thanks to Ruby, I've managed to build it (sort of)!
